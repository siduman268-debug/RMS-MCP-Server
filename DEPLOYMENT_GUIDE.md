## Deployment Commands

### Option 1: Deploy All Objects at Once

cd C:\Users\Admin\RMS\rms-mcp-server

# Deploy all custom objects
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app/main/default/objects
```

### Option 2: Deploy Objects Individually
```bash
# Deploy Ocean Freight Rate object
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app/main/default/objects/Ocean_Freight_Rate__c

# Deploy Margin Rule object
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app/main/default/objects/Margin_Rule__c

# Deploy Surcharge object
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app/main/default/objects/Surcharge__c

# Deploy RMS Flow Setting object
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app/main/default/objects/RMS_Flow_Setting__c
```

### Option 3: Deploy Everything (Objects + Classes + Named Credentials)
```bash
# Deploy entire force-app directory
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app/main/default
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Object Manager
