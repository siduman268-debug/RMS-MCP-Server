## 📋 Post-Demo Q&A Preparation

### Technical Questions
- **Q**: "How does the multi-tenant architecture work?"
- **A**: "Each customer has isolated data through Supabase RLS policies and JWT tokens. No data leakage between tenants."

- **Q**: "What happens if the database goes down?"
- **A**: "We have fallback rates built into the system, and the API gracefully handles errors with proper HTTP status codes."

- **Q**: "How do you handle rate updates?"
- **A**: "Rates are updated through the MCP interface or direct database updates. The system uses materialized views for performance."

### Business Questions
- **Q**: "What's the ROI of this system?"
- **A**: "Based on time savings alone, we expect 95% reduction in quote generation time, translating to significant cost savings and improved customer satisfaction."

- **Q**: "How does this integrate with our existing processes?"
- **A**: "The system is designed to work alongside existing workflows. Salesforce integration is seamless, and the API can be called from any system."

- **Q**: "What about data security?"
- **A**: "We use industry-standard JWT authentication, row-level security, and all data is encrypted in transit and at rest."

### MCP & AI Questions
- **Q**: "What is MCP and why is it important?"
- **A**: "MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard that allows AI agents to connect to external systems. It's the foundation for the future of AI-powered business applications."

- **Q**: "How does Claude Desktop integration work?"
- **A**: "Claude Desktop connects to our RMS server via MCP and can use 20+ freight management tools through natural language. Users can ask questions like 'Find me the best rate for Mumbai to LA' and get intelligent responses."

- **Q**: "What's the future potential with other AI agents?"
- **A**: "The same MCP server can connect to AgentForce, AutoGPT, and any other MCP-compatible AI agent. This means one RMS system can power an entire ecosystem of AI assistants."
